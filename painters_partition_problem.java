/* BINARY SEARCH                                                             Date: 22-Jun-2021
Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N.

Element C[i] represents length of ith board.

You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.

Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.

2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, a board
cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
A painter will only paint contiguous boards. Which means a
configuration where painter 1 paints board 1 and 3 but not 2 is
invalid.

Return the ans % 10000003

Input 1:
    A = 2
    B = 5
    C = [1, 10]
Output 1:
    50
Explanation 1:
    Possibility 1:- same painter paints both blocks, time taken = 55units
    Possibility 2:- Painter 1 paints block 1, painter 2 paints block 2, time take = max(5, 50) = 50
    There are no other distinct ways to paint boards.
    ans = 50%10000003

Input 2:
    A = 10
    B = 1
    C = [1, 8, 11, 3]
Output 2:
    11
